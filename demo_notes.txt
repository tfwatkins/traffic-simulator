DEMO WALKTHROUGH NOTES:

1. **Start the Simulation**
   - Run `test_graph.py`
   - A 16x16 city grid will load with green/red/gray intersections and cars will begin spawning.

2. **Observe Lights**
   - Green: passable.
   - Red: cars will queue.
   - Gray: intersections with no lightâ€”cars proceed freely.

3. **Watch Car Behavior**
   - Cars spawn at the edges.
   - They queue at red lights with a small buffer.
   - If congestion is detected using a quadtree, cars may pause to avoid piling up.

4. **Dynamic Flow**
   - After several seconds, cars form realistic queues.
   - Some intersections jam due to one-way traffic or simultaneous light blocks.

5. **Highlight Features**
   - Dijkstra's path selection.
   - Queuing with pixel spacing.
   - Collision prevention via quadtree queries.
   - Visualization of urban flow and bottlenecks.

6. **End the Demo**
   - Close the pygame window to exit.
