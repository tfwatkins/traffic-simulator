         Entry/Exit Grid (16x16)

         | o  o  o  o  o  o  |
         | o     +     o     |   o = intersection (gray)
         | o  +     +     o  |   + = traffic light (green/red)

 - Cars (rectangles) spawn at edges.
 - Move along Dijkstra path to opposite side.
 - Obey lights, form queues with pixel gaps.
 - Query neighbors via quadtree to avoid overlap.
